<p align="justify">What are the objectives and challenges we aim to address, and have there been any prior initiatives in this regard? Each year, a staggering 703,000 individuals succumb to suicide, while countless others grapple with suicidal thoughts. This tragic reality sends shockwaves through families, communities, and nations, leaving enduring scars on those left behind. Suicide transcends age, emerging as the fourth leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds worldwide in 2019. This global crisis extends far beyond affluent nations, with over 77% of suicides occurring in low- and middle-income countries in 2019 [WHO 2023]. Based on data from the Pusat Informasi Kriminal Nasional Kepolisian RI, in the last 11 years (2012-2023) there were 2,112 suicides in Indonesia. As many as 985 cases or 46.63% of them were committed by teenagers. </p>

<p align="justify">Within the complex tapestry of causes contributing to suicide, mental health emerges as a critical factor, and its prominence is increasingly evident in Indonesia. Alarming statistics from the National Information Centre of Crime at the Police Department indicate a surge in suicide cases, reaching 971 from January to October 2023, predominantly affecting students and university students. Based on a survey from the Indonesia National Adolescent Mental Health Survey (I-NAMHS) in 2022, explain that 5.5% of teenagers aged 10-17 years were diagnosed with mental health disorders. The root of this crisis lies in various factors, including the fragility of mental resilience. Research from the Indonesia National Adolescent Mental Health reveals that one in three teenagers aged 10-17 exhibits signs of mental health issues, exacerbated by academic and social challenges during this critical developmental phase. </p>

<p align="justify">This capstone project was developed because there is an urgent need to address the growing mental health issue, especially among Indonesian university students and students in general. The severity of the situation is shown by the concerning increase in suicide cases, as shown by data from the National Information Center of Crime. With 971 cases documented between January and October of 2023, it is obvious that taking preventative action is necessary to stop this alarming trend. </p>
